## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).



How to play!!
You as a player have to use the keyboard arrows keys (up, down, right and left) to move your character 
You have to cross the screen from the grass side to water side, but watch your character from the Enemies (Cockroach) if they touch yours, It will be moved back to the grass side and you will lose one point while you need 5 points to win the game every time you reach the top one point 
Collected other ways if you lose all you point you have 4 more times to recover or you lose the game
